                <p class="header-text-p2">Skateboarding has become one of the most popular means of transport and
                    alternative sports for kids and
                    adults across the globe. Whether you are a student seeking a product to go around, an adult ready to
                    embrace your inner child or a skateboarding enthusiast, skateboards can entertain you in all the
                    ways
                    you want. Getting around in a city full of fumes and traffic can be trickier than you think. So, you
                    should carefully choose a perfect fit for you before hopping on a board and take off. Most beginners
                    grab the skateboard that they find appealing without getting into its nitty-gritty. This kind of
                    attitude can make you spend your money on a product that isn’t right for you. That’s why we have
                    sifted
                    through several boards and reviewed the 7 best skateboards in 2021 on the market to help you get
                    your
                    hands on the product that is a good match for you.</p>

            <h1 class="last-content-h1">Best Skateboards Buying Guide</h1>
            <p class="last-content-p">Every skateboard mentioned above comes with its own set of features. So, it is
                always advisable to
                scrutinize the entire market before spending your hard-earned money on a skateboard. You must always
                pick one that suits your skillsets as well as budget.</p>

            <p class="last-content-p"> If you are purchasing a skateboard for the first time, it can be an overwhelming
                experience. In this
                guide, we have shed light on some important factors that can help you make an informed decision and get
                your hands on the best skateboard.</p>
            <h1 class="last-content-h1">What Factors Should You Consider Before Choosing a Skateboard?</h1>
            <h3 class="last-content-h3">Deck Size</h3>
            <p class="last-content-p">Look for a skateboard with a deck width that is in proportion to the size of your
                shoe. If your shoe size ranges between 6.5 to 9 inches, the deck should be between 7.5 to 8 inches. The
                deck size also varies depending upon the surface you will be riding on</p>
            <p class="last-content-p">Generally, a deck of 8-inch wide and 30-inch long is considered suitable for most
                people. However, wider boards are perfect for beginners as they offer the best balance control and allow
                you to have a firm standing position.</p>
            <h3 class="last-content-h3">Trucks</h3>
            <p class="last-content-p">The size of the trucks depends on your deck size. If the length of the axle
                matches the deck width, it will ensure the trucks will fit the broadness of the board. Thus, the proper
                alignment will lead to the smooth sliding of the wheels.</p>
            <h3 class="last-content-h3">Wheels</h3>
            <p class="last-content-p">Wheels determine the speed limits of your mini cruiser. Typically, the best
                skateboard comes with mid-sized wheels that fall in the range of 52 mm to 54 mm are easier to be fixed
                on the trucks, eliminating the need for a riser pad. However, boards with wheels bigger than this range
                require a riser pad to sit beneath the trucks to offer swift turning.</p>
            <h3 class="last-content-h3">Bearings</h3>
            <p class="last-content-p">Bearings are the key to spin the wheels. The inner diameter of the bearings of a
                standard skateboard is 8mm. You should also consider the ABEC rating system of the bearings as it
                determines their tolerance as well as physical limit. Besides, you also have to keep the bearings clean
                and oiled to maintain them and extend their durability.</p>
            <h1 class="last-content-h1">What Size of Skateboard is Best For You?</h1>
            <p class="last-content-p">If you are purchasing a skateboard for the first time, you probably don’t know
                which size is perfect for you. Typically, skateboards are available in four different sizes such as:</p>
            <h3 class="last-content-h3">Micro-Skateboard</h3>
            <p class="last-content-p">This skateboard is suitable for kids aged around 5 years, having a shoe size of 3
                or less. The width of these mini cruisers usually falls between 6.5 to 7 inches, while their length may
                range between 27 to 28 inches.</p>
            <h3 class="last-content-h3">Mini-Skateboard</h3>
            <p class="last-content-p">This skateboard is popular among children between 6 to 8 years old with a shoe
                size of 4 to 6. The width of this variant is seven inches approximately, while its length is usually
                around 28 inches.</p>
            <h3 class="last-content-h3">Mid-Sized Skateboard</h3>
            <p class="last-content-p">The mid-sized skateboards are ideal for individuals between the age of 9 to 12
                years old with a shoe size of 7 to 8. Their width is usually around 7.5 inches, while their length can
                be nearly 28 inches.</p>
            <h3 class="last-content-h3">Full-Sized Skateboard</h3>
            <p class="last-content-p">These skateboards are preferred by teenagers with a shoe size of 9 or more. The
                width of this sports equipment usually lies between 7.5 to 8 inches, while their length ranges between
                29 to 32 inches.</p>
            <h1 class="last-content-h1">Final Words</h1>
            <p class="last-content-p">Skateboarding is not a sport that you can learn easily. You have to invest a lot
                of time and effort to get adept at basic skills like balancing and some tricks.</p>
            <p class="last-content-p">Getting the right skateboard can make all the difference in your learning and
                skating experience. We hope the products we have reviewed and our buying guide help you choose the
                perfect skateboard that meets your expectations.</p>
